# Business Logic Documentation

This document outlines the core business logic and user stories for the messaging application. Each section describes a key feature, including a Mermaid graph to visualize the flow and bullet-point descriptions for each scenario.

## 1. User Management & Authentication

### 1.1 User Registration

A new user signs up for the messaging application.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User starts registration] --> B{Provide Username, Email, Password};
    B --> C{Validate input};
    C -- Invalid --> D[Return error: Invalid input];
    C -- Valid --> E{Check if Username/Email already exists};
    E -- Exists --> F[Return error: Username/Email taken];
    E -- Not exists --> G{Hash Password};
    G --> H{Set Default Privacy Settings};
    H --> I{Create User in Database};
    I --> J{Generate JWT Access & Refresh Tokens};
    J --> K[Return Auth Response with Tokens and User Info];
```

*   **User Initiates Registration**: The user provides a unique username, a valid email address, and a strong password.
*   **Input Validation**: The system validates the format and completeness of the provided data (e.g., email format, password strength).
*   **Uniqueness Check**: The system verifies that the chosen username and email address are not already registered.
*   **Password Hashing**: The provided password is securely hashed using bcrypt before storage.
*   **Default Privacy Settings**: New users are assigned default privacy settings (e.g., public posts, friends can see friend list).
*   **User Creation**: A new user record is created in the database.
*   **Token Generation**: JWT access and refresh tokens are generated for the newly registered user.
*   **Authentication Response**: The system returns the generated tokens and basic user information, indicating successful registration and login.

### 1.2 User Login

An existing user logs into the application.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User starts login] --> B{Provide Email, Password};
    B --> C{Validate input};
    C -- Invalid --> D[Return error: Invalid input];
    C -- Valid --> E{Find User by Email};
    E -- Not found --> F[Return error: Invalid credentials];
    E -- Found --> G{Compare Hashed Password};
    G -- Mismatch --> F;
    G -- Match --> H{Generate JWT Access & Refresh Tokens};
    H --> I{Store Refresh Token in Redis};
    I --> J[Return Auth Response with Tokens and User Info];
```

*   **User Initiates Login**: The user provides their registered email address and password.
*   **Input Validation**: The system validates the format of the email and ensures the password field is not empty.
*   **User Lookup**: The system attempts to find a user record matching the provided email address.
*   **Password Verification**: If a user is found, the provided password is compared against the stored hashed password.
*   **Token Generation**: Upon successful password verification, new JWT access and refresh tokens are generated.
*   **Refresh Token Storage**: The refresh token is stored in Redis, associated with the user ID, for future token refreshes.
*   **Authentication Response**: The system returns the generated tokens and basic user information, confirming successful login.

### 1.3 User Logout

A user logs out of the application.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User requests logout] --> B{Extract UserID and Access Token};
    B --> C{Blacklist Access Token in Redis};
    C --> D{Delete Refresh Token from Redis};
    D --> E[Return success message];
```

*   **User Initiates Logout**: The user sends a request to log out.
*   **Token Extraction**: The system extracts the user ID from the current access token and the access token itself.
*   **Access Token Blacklisting**: The current access token is added to a Redis blacklist to immediately invalidate it, preventing further use. The blacklist entry has an expiration matching the token's original TTL.
*   **Refresh Token Deletion**: The user's refresh token is removed from Redis, preventing future token refreshes.
*   **Logout Confirmation**: The system returns a success message.

### 1.4 Update User Profile

A user updates their profile information.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User requests profile update] --> B{Extract UserID from Token};
    B --> C{Receive Update Data};
    C --> D{Validate Update Data};
    D -- Invalid --> E[Return error: Invalid input];
    D -- Valid --> F{Check for Username/Email conflicts (if updated)};
    F -- Conflict --> E;
    F -- No conflict --> G{Hash New Password (if updated)};
    G --> H{Update User in Database};
    H --> I[Return Updated User Info];
```

*   **User Initiates Update**: The user sends a request to update their profile, providing fields like username, full name, bio, etc.
*   **User Identification**: The system extracts the user ID from the authentication token.
*   **Data Validation**: The provided update data is validated (e.g., username length, email format).
*   **Conflict Check**: If the username or email is being updated, the system checks for conflicts with existing users.
*   **Password Update (Conditional)**: If the password is being updated, the current password is verified, and the new password is hashed before storage.
*   **Database Update**: The user's profile information is updated in the database.
*   **Updated Profile Return**: The system returns the updated user object (excluding sensitive information like password hash).

### 1.5 Manage Privacy Settings

A user configures their privacy settings.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User requests privacy settings update] --> B{Extract UserID from Token};
    B --> C{Receive Privacy Settings Data};

    D -- Valid --> F{Update User Privacy Settings in Database};
    F --> G[Return Updated Privacy Settings];
```

*   **User Initiates Privacy Update**: The user sends a request to modify their privacy settings (e.g., default post privacy, who can see their friends list).
*   **User Identification**: The system extracts the user ID from the authentication token.
*   **Data Validation**: The provided privacy settings are validated against predefined types (e.g., PUBLIC, FRIENDS, ONLY_ME).
*   **Database Update**: The user's privacy settings are updated or created in the database.
